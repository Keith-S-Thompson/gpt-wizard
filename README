This is gpt-wizard release 0.1.  gpt-wizard is a Perl script designed
to automate much of the process of building and installing Globus
and related software.

Files included in this distribution:

README			This file.
INSTALL			The (trivial) installation instructions.
gpt-wizard		The gpt-wizard command itself.
gpt-wizard.1		The man page in nroff source format.
gpt-wizard.1.txt	The man page, formatted as plain text.
gpt-wizard.1.ps		The man page, formatted as PostScript
sample.conf		A sample configuration file.

The primary document is the man page.  There is also some lower-level
documentation included as comments in the gpt-wizard script itself.
(No I didn't use Perl's standard POD documentation format; it's
just comments.)
