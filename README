This is gpt-wizard release 0.6.1.

gpt-wizard is a Perl script designed to automate much of the process
of building and installing Globus and related software.

Files included in this distribution:

README			This file
INSTALL			The installation instructions
Relnotes		Release notes
gpt-wizard		The gpt-wizard command itself
gpt-wizard.1		The man page in nroff source format
gpt-wizard.1.txt	The man page, formatted as plain text
gpt-wizard.1.ps		The man page, formatted as PostScript
install-gpt-wizard      An installation script; see INSTALL
sample.conf		A sample configuration file (out of date)

The primary document is the man page.  There is also some lower-level
documentation included as comments in the gpt-wizard script itself.
(No I didn't use Perl's standard POD documentation format; it's
just comments.)
