.SH NAME
gpt-wizard \- Build and install GPT bundles
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B "gpt-wizard -help"
.B "gpt-wizard [options] config-file"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I gpt-wizard
command builds and installs a specified set of GPT bundles, driven
by a simple ASCII configuration file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -help
Display a brief help message on stdout and exits.

.IP -validate-only
Validate the configuration file, display some information, and exit without
building anything.  Useful to detect errors in a configuration file.

.IP -cleanup
Delete the temporary directory on completion.  This is the default
behavior.  Use "-nocleanup" to keep the temporary directory.

.IP -postinstall
Run the
.I gpt-postinstall
command.  This is the default behavior; use "-nogpt-postinstall" if
you don't want to run
.IR gpt-postinstall .

.IP -startup
Update system files and start services.  This is the default behavior;
use "-nostartup" if you don't want to do this.
.br
.B NOTE:
This is currently implemented only on Linux systems.  On Solaris and AIX,
the "-nostartup" option is mandatory.

.IP -gpt-verbose
Pass the "-verbose" option to
.I gpt-install
and/or
.IR gpt-build .
This will produce voluminous output, especially when building source
bundles.

.IP -gpt-install-only
Pass the "-install-only" option to
.IR gpt-build .
This doesn't affect binary installations
.RI ( gpt-install ).
.B NOTE:
This option is probably obsolete for the current version of
.IR GPT .
-gpt-ignore-errors
Ignore errors from
.I gpt-install
and
.IR gpt-build .
Not recommended.

.IP -aix-kludge
Use an existing GPT installation.  This was implemented to work around
some obscure problems on an AIX system.  Not recommended unless you know
what you're doing.
-debugging
Enable debugging output.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The
.I gpt-wizard
command requires a configuration file to be specified on the
command line.  The name of the file is irrelevant.  I typically use
something like

.B <machine-name>-globus-<version>-<kind>.conf

for example,

.B tf005i-globus-2.2.3-src.conf

but if you want to call it
.B foobar.baz
I won't complain.

The configuration file is a plain text file with a simple syntax.
Everything from a
.B '#'
character to the end of the line is treated as a comment and ignored.
Leading whitespace, trailing whitespace, and empty lines are also
ignored.

Each line consists of a variable name, followed by whitespace,
followed by the value of the variable.  All variable names must
be specified in upper case.  The value is generally an arbitrary
string, which may include embedded blanks; there may be restrictions
depending on the type of the variable (see below).  Some variables
are optional, some are mandatory, and some may appear multiple times.
Certain variables may also have attributes associated with them;
these are given in the form "name=value" on the same line.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

.IP CONFIG_FILE_REVISION
Usually an RCS or CVS "$Revision: 1.3 $" tag.
.br
Type: string
.br
Optional.

.IP TEMP_DIR
Location for
.IR gpt-wizard 's
temporary directory.  The temporary directory will be created under the
specified directory.
.br
Type: existing directory
.br
Optional.  Default is "/tmp".

.IP DOWNLOAD_DIR
Directory to be used for downloaded files.
.br
Type: existing directory
.br
Required if any files are specified as URLs; otherwise optional.
If any files are specified as URLs, they will be downloaded into
subdirectories of this directory.  For any files that have already
been downloaded, the local copy will be used.

.IP PATH
The value for the $PATH environment variable.
Mandatory.

.IP ENV
An environment variable setting, of the form "VAR" or "VAR=value".
If no value is specified, the variable is set to the empty string.
.br
Type: string
.br
Optional.  May occur multiple times.

.IP INSTALLER_USER
The name of the Unix account to use for the installation.
.br
Optional.  Default is "globus".

.IP INSTALLER_GROUP
The name of the Unix group to use for the installation.
.br
Optional.  Default is "globus".

.IP USE_SDSC_SU
Use the non-standard "su" command in use at SDSC.  Not recommended
for sites other than SDSC.
.br
Type: boolean
.br
Optional.  Default is 0.

.IP UMASK
Specify an octal umask for the installation.  The default value is almost
always best.
.br
Type: string (must be a valid octal number)
.br
Optional.  Default is 022.

.IP GPT_TARBALL
The location of the source tarball (*.tar.gz) file for GPT.  Binary and
RPM distributions are not yet supported.
.br
Type: file or URL
.br
Mandatory.

.IP BUNDLE
A GPT bundle or package.  It may be a source, binary, or rpm bundle.
Multiple bundles may be specified.
.br
Attributes:
.br
    kind=binary
.I or
kind=source
.I or
kind=rpm
.br
    flavor=<flavor>
.br
    option=<option>
.br
If a kind is not specified,
.I gpt-wizard
attempts to guess based on the file name.
.br
Multiple flavors may be specified, separated by commas, e.g.,
"flavor=gcc32dbg,gcc32".
.br
Options are passed to gpt-install or gpt-build.
.br
Type: file or URL
.br
Mandatory.  Multiple bundles may be specified.

.IP UPDATE
A GPT update package.  This is normally a source package.
.br
The same attributes may be specified as for bundles.
.br
Type: file or URL
.br
Optional.  Multiple updates may be specified.

.IP PRE_POSTINSTALL
Specify a command to be executed before running gpt-postinstall.
So far, I have only used this on AIX to run mds-aix-relink.sh, which
works around some AIX-specific libtool problems.  Any occurrence of
the string BUILD_DIR is replaced with the name of the build directory.
.br
Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
.br
Type: string (must be a valid command).
.br
Optional.

.IP GPT_LOCATION
The location in which to install the GPT, the Grid Packaging Toolkit.
.br
Type: new directory (must be empty if it already exists).
.br
Mandatory.

.IP GLOBUS_LOCATION
The location in which to install the Globus and other components.
This will typically be the same as GPT_LOCATION.
.br
Type: new directory (must be empty if it already exists).
.br
Mandatory.

.IP GLOBUS_VAR_DIRECTORY
A local directory in which to install the "var" directory.
If GLOBUS_LOCATION is on an NFS-mounted file system, the gatekeeper
(which runs as root) will often not be able to write to its log file,
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/globus-gatekeeper.log.  If GLOBUS_VAR_DIRECTORY
is specified (normally on a local filesystem), $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var
will be created as a symbolic link to it.
.br
Type: new directory (must be empty if it already exists).
.br
Optional.

.IP GLOBUS_HOSTNAME
...
