Installation is simple; there's no configure script and no Makefile.
Just unpack the tar file, copy the file "gpt-wizard" to an appropriate
directory in your $PATH, and copy the file "gpt-wizard.1" to the
"man1" subdirectory of an appropriate directory in your $MANPATH.

If your Perl executable is somewhere other than /usr/bin/perl, you'll
need to edit the "#!" line (line 1 of gpt-wizard).

Requirements:

gpt-wizard requires Perl version 5.004 or higher.  It uses the
File::Basename, Getopt::Long, and POSIX modules, all of which are
part of the standard Perl distribution.

If you want to specify ftp and/or http URLs for some files, you'll
need to have the ncftpget and/or wget command in the $PATH that you
specify in the config file.

gpt-wizard is currently supported on Linux, SunOS (Solaris), and AIX
systems, but automated service startup is only supported on Linux.
Support for other Unix-like systems should not be difficult to provide;
it would probably just involve modifying the check that gpt-wizard
performs on startup.
