To install gpt-wizard, run the "install-gpt-wizard" script from the
source directory (the directory you created by unpacking the tarball).
It has several options; run with "-help" to display this usage message:

========================================================================
Usage: install-gpt-wizard [options]
Installs gpt-wizard.
This must be executed in the source directory so it can find
the files to be installed.
    -help          Show this message and exit.
    -perl   PERL   Full path to Perl interpreter; default is /usr/bin/perl
    -apps   APPS   Install in APPS/gpt-wizard-VERSION
    -prefix DIR    Install in DIR
    -symlink       Make DIR/gpt-wizard a symlink to gpt-wizard-VERSION
                   Valid only with "-apps"
    -force         Allow installation directory to be an existing
                   non-empty directory; by default, it must be nonexistent
                   or empty
    -dryrun        Don't do the installation, just show the steps
Exactly one of "-apps" and "-prefix" must be specified.
========================================================================

The "-apps" prefix can be used if your system has an applications
directory (at SDSC, we use "/usr/local/apps").  This will create a
"gpt-wizard-VERSION" (e.g., "gpt-wizard-0.7.0") directory under the
apps directory, with sbin, man, and etc subdirectories under that.
You can also specify the "-symlink" option to create "gpt-wizard"
as a symbolic link to the "gpt-wizard-VERSION" directory.

If you want to specify the exact installation directory, use the
"-prefix" option.

The installation directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
By default, it needs to be either nonexistent or empty; use the
"-force" option to install in an existing non-empty directory.

If you prefer, you can just copy the gpt-wizard command to any
directory you choose, or execute it from the source directory.
You may need to customize the "#!" line if your Perl interpreter
isn't in /usr/bin.

Requirements:

gpt-wizard requires Perl version 5.004 or higher.  It uses the
File::Basename, Getopt::Long, and POSIX modules, all of which are
part of the standard Perl distribution.

gpt-wizard is currently supported on Linux, SunOS (Solaris), and AIX
systems, but automated service startup is only supported on Linux.
Support for other Unix-like systems should not be difficult to provide;
it would probably just involve modifying the check that gpt-wizard
performs on startup.
