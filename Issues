AIX: Obscure failure invoking build_gpt from install_nmi.  Somewhere in
the bowels of Perl, something thinks it's setuid, so it refuses to
accept a "-e".  Workaround: Build GPT manually, then use "install-nmi
-aix-kludge'.  Solution: Figure out how to completely drop privileges,
so both real and effective uids are non-root.  The current stopgap
solution is the USE_SDSC_SU config option

"gpt-build -std-flavors" seems to default to gcc flavors; COMPILER in
config file is ignored.  CORRECTION: On AIX, it uses *both* gcc and
vendorcc.  The flavors installed are {gcc,vendorcc}32{,dbg}{,pthr} --
which is undoubtedly why the build takes so bloody long.  (But yes,
$Config{COMPILER} is ignored as is $Config{USE_MPI} -- which is
probably ok.)

NMI 2.1 release was modified on the FTP site after it was released
and announced.  Appropriate flamage delivered.

With USE_SDSC_SU, the child process doesn't inherit the umask -- which
makes me wonder what else isn't being inherited ($PATH?).  I may need
to set the umask (and what else?) explicitly in the invoked command:
    su globus -c "umask 027 ; some_command"
