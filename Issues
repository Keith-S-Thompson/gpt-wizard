AIX: Obscure failure invoking build_gpt from install_nmi.  Somewhere in
the bowels of Perl, something thinks it's setuid, so it refuses to
accept a "-e".  Workaround: Build GPT manually, then use
"install-nmi -aix-kludge'.  Solution (not implemented): Figure out how
to completely drop privileges, so both real and effective uids are
non-root.

"gpt-build -std-flavors" seems to default to gcc flavors;
COMPILER in config file is ignored.

NMI 2.1 release was modified on the FTP site after it was released
and announced.  Appropriate flamage delivered.
