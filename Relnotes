Release notes for gpt-wizard

Changes from release 0.1.1 to release 0.2:

    Bug fixes and enhancements for inetd and xinetd configuration.

    The default for the "-startup" option is now "-nostartup".

    Use wget for both ftp and http URLs; dropped use of ncftpget.

    New config variable WGET specifies the full path to the "wget"
    command; if not set, search in the specified PATH.

    Create a $GLOBUS_LOCATION/.gpt-wizard directory containing a
    copy of the config file and an "info" file with information about
    the build.

    Support line continuation with '\' in config file.

    Added ".PREFIX" pseudo-option, prepended to any following file
    or URL options specified with relative pathnames.

    Miscellaneous bug fixes.

    (In spite of all this, the TODO list has gotten longer, not
    shorter.)

Changes from release 0.1 to release 0.1.1:

    Added -version option

    Disabled obsolete -gpt-log option.

    Updated explanation of option parsing.
