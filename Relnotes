Release notes for gpt-wizard

Changes from release 0.5.1 to release 0.6:

    gpt-wizard can now be executed from a non-root account (finally!).
    Any actions that need to be performed by root are added to the
    list of manual steps at the end of the output log.

    Some cleanup in the man page.

Changes from release 0.5 to release 0.5.1:

    Added install-gpt-wizard to release.
    (It was left out of release 0.5 due to operator error.)

Changes from release 0.4 to release 0.5:

    Dropped support for GPT 1.X (all current Globus releases include
    GPT 2.X or better).

    For binary builds, invoke "gpt-build -nosrc <flavors>" to build
    globus_config.h

    Dropped support for URLs.  All files specified in a config file
    must be directly visible.  The DOWNLOAD_DIR and WGET configuration
    variables are no longer recognized.

    Re-worked some internal data structures, allowing a single
    bundle to be specified multiple times with different attributes.
    For example, it's now possible to build a bundle with "-static"
    for some flavors, and without "-static" for others.

Changes from release 0.3.3 to release 0.4:

    Added JOB_MANAGER configuration variable.
    Handle new gpt-query output format (needed for building updates).
    Unset $LANG environment variable before invoking gpt-build
	(see <https://bugzilla.ncsa.uiuc.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=131>).
    Append '~' to backup file names.
    Expand ~user in config file.

Changes from release 0.3.2 to release 0.3.3:

    Bug fix: Don't localize grid-info.conf.
    See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=660#c8>.

Changes from release 0.3.1 to release 0.3.2:

    Bug fix: Use WGET configuration variable for file downloading if
    it's set.

    Added configuration variables TAR and GZIP.

    Clearer messages when gpt-wizard terminates abnormally.

    Updated list of files under $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc that
    need to be localized if GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY is set; see
    <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=660#c8>

Changes from release 0.3 to release 0.3.1:

    Bug fix: ftp and http downloads were not working.

Changes from release 0.2 to release 0.3:

    Removed configuration variable GLOBUS_VAR_DIRECTORY, replaced
    with the more general GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.  If this is set,
    the tmp and var subdirectories, and certain files under etc, are
    automatically replaced with symlinks into GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.

    Print any manual steps even if gpt-wizard terminates abnormally.

    Provide better instructions for inetd/xinetd.

    Corrected bug in inetd.conf entry for gsigatekeeper.

    Bug fix: Pay attention to GLOBUS_HOSTNAME if it's set.

    Allow root INSTALLER_USER and INSTALLER_GROUP.  (To do: allow
    gpt-wizard to be run by a non-root user.)

    Miscellanous bells, whistles, and bug fixes.

Changes from release 0.1.1 to release 0.2:

    Bug fixes and enhancements for inetd and xinetd configuration.

    The default for the "-startup" option is now "-nostartup".

    Use wget for both ftp and http URLs; dropped use of ncftpget.

    New config variable WGET specifies the full path to the "wget"
    command; if not set, search in the specified PATH.

    Create a $GLOBUS_LOCATION/.gpt-wizard directory containing a
    copy of the config file and an "info" file with information about
    the build.

    Support line continuation with '\' in config file.

    Added ".PREFIX" pseudo-option, prepended to any following file
    or URL options specified with relative pathnames.

    Miscellaneous bug fixes.

    (In spite of all this, the TODO list has gotten longer, not
    shorter.)

Changes from release 0.1 to release 0.1.1:

    Added -version option

    Disabled obsolete -gpt-log option.

    Updated explanation of option parsing.
