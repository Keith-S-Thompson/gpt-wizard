Release notes for gpt-wizard

Changes from release 0.2 to release 0.3:

    Removed configuration variable GLOBUS_VAR_DIRECTORY, replaced
    with the more general GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.  If this is set,
    the tmp and var subdirectories, and certain files under etc, are
    automatically replaced with symlinks into GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.

    Print any manual steps even if gpt-wizard terminates abnormally.

    Provide better instructions for inetd/xinetd.

    Corrected bug in inetd.conf entry for gsigatekeeper.

    Bug fix: Pay attention to GLOBUS_HOSTNAME if it's set.

    Allow root INSTALLER_USER and INSTALLER_GROUP.  (To do: allow
    gpt-wizard to be run by a non-root user.)

    Miscellanous bells, whistles, and bug fixes.

Changes from release 0.1.1 to release 0.2:

    Bug fixes and enhancements for inetd and xinetd configuration.

    The default for the "-startup" option is now "-nostartup".

    Use wget for both ftp and http URLs; dropped use of ncftpget.

    New config variable WGET specifies the full path to the "wget"
    command; if not set, search in the specified PATH.

    Create a $GLOBUS_LOCATION/.gpt-wizard directory containing a
    copy of the config file and an "info" file with information about
    the build.

    Support line continuation with '\' in config file.

    Added ".PREFIX" pseudo-option, prepended to any following file
    or URL options specified with relative pathnames.

    Miscellaneous bug fixes.

    (In spite of all this, the TODO list has gotten longer, not
    shorter.)

Changes from release 0.1 to release 0.1.1:

    Added -version option

    Disabled obsolete -gpt-log option.

    Updated explanation of option parsing.
