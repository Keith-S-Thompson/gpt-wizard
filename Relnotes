Release notes for gpt-wizard

Changes from release 0.7.4 to release 0.7.5:

    New configuration pseudo-option: .PARAM
    This implements a simple macro facility, and allows
    for easier customization of config files for performing similar
    installations at multiple sites.

    Minor tweaks in manual steps (update MDS config files before
    starting daemons, mention that setup-gsi may not exist for
    Globus 3.X).

Changes from release 0.7.3 to release 0.7.4:

    New configuration option: INTEL_WORKAROUND.  This implements
    a workaround for a problem in the interaction between
    Intel's version 8 compiler and the Globus configuration
    and build procedure.  See Globus Bugzilla # 1651,
    <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1651>

    Updated sample configuration file, now called "sample.gptw"
    (was "sample.conf").

    Expanded user instructions (disable GIIS, set $GLOBUS_LOCATION
    before running setup-gsi).

Changes from release 0.7.2 to release 0.7.3:

    Implemented some heuristics to determine a good order for building
    different flavors for an update package.  (The order can determine
    which version of an executable is installed as the default).
    If MPI_FLAVORS_ARE_STATIC is specified, the static flavors will
    be built first, so the default executables are the dynamically
    linked ones.

    Note: When building the 9 basic Globus bundles, I recommend
    building the information-services bundles *first*, so the default
    executables aren't the ones that depend on the pthreads library.

    New command-line option: "-force-arch".
    gpt-wizard is currently only supported on Linux, SunOS (Solaris),
    and AIX; this option lets you override the check.  This is for
    experimental purposes.

    For MPICH-G2, create the ".globus-location" file unconditionally.

    A failed "~user" expansion in a configuration file is now a
    fatal error.

    Old releases of gpt-wizard are now in the OLD subdirectory on
    the ftp site.

Changes from release 0.7.1 to release 0.7.2:

    Bug fixes in MPICH-G2 support.

Changes from release 0.7.0 to release 0.7.1:

    Fixed a couple of typos.

    Made the terminology more consistent: We refer to "configuration
    options", not "configuration variables".

Changes from release 0.6.1 to release 0.7.0:

    New configuration option IS_UPDATE.
    This is an optional boolean option, off by default.
    If set, apply updates to an existing Globus installation.

    New configuration option MPICH-G2.
    If set, build and install MPICH-G2.
    See man page for details.

    New configuration option MPI_FLAVORS_ARE_STATIC.
    This is an optional boolean option, off by default.
    If set, all flavors whose names start with "mpi" (e.g.,
    "mpicc32dbg") are to be built with the "-static" option.
    See <https://bugzilla.ncsa.uiuc.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=46>.

    New command-line option "-temp-dir <dir>", overrides the TEMP_DIR
    configuration option.

    Show command-line arguments at top of output.

    Kill any running subprocesses when gpt-wizard is killed by
    a signal.

    Bail out after 100 errors in config file.

    Better handling of GLOBUS_HOSTNAME: if specified, set the
    environment variable in the inetd or xinetd configuration.

    Deleted obsolete command-line option "-gpt-install-only".

    Show "-nonroot" option for "setup-gsi".

    Bug fix: Don't try to set up a jobmanager if we haven't run
    gpt-postinstall.

    Bug fix: Corrected typo in suggested inetd.conf lines.

Changes from release 0.6 to release 0.6.1:

    Bug fix: The "options=..." attribute is no longer ignored.
    For source bundles, this bug was introduced by a typo in release 0.4.
    For binary bundles, it has always existed.

Changes from release 0.5.1 to release 0.6:

    gpt-wizard can now be executed from a non-root account (finally!).
    Any actions that need to be performed by root are added to the
    list of manual steps at the end of the output log.

    Some cleanup in the man page.

Changes from release 0.5 to release 0.5.1:

    Added install-gpt-wizard to release.
    (It was left out of release 0.5 due to operator error.)

Changes from release 0.4 to release 0.5:

    Dropped support for GPT 1.X (all current Globus releases include
    GPT 2.X or better).

    For binary builds, invoke "gpt-build -nosrc <flavors>" to build
    globus_config.h

    Dropped support for URLs.  All files specified in a config file
    must be directly visible.  The DOWNLOAD_DIR and WGET configuration
    variables are no longer recognized.

    Re-worked some internal data structures, allowing a single
    bundle to be specified multiple times with different attributes.
    For example, it's now possible to build a bundle with "-static"
    for some flavors, and without "-static" for others.

Changes from release 0.3.3 to release 0.4:

    Added JOB_MANAGER configuration variable.
    Handle new gpt-query output format (needed for building updates).
    Unset $LANG environment variable before invoking gpt-build
	(see <https://bugzilla.ncsa.uiuc.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=131>).
    Append '~' to backup file names.
    Expand ~user in config file.

Changes from release 0.3.2 to release 0.3.3:

    Bug fix: Don't localize grid-info.conf.
    See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=660#c8>.

Changes from release 0.3.1 to release 0.3.2:

    Bug fix: Use WGET configuration variable for file downloading if
    it's set.

    Added configuration variables TAR and GZIP.

    Clearer messages when gpt-wizard terminates abnormally.

    Updated list of files under $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc that
    need to be localized if GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY is set; see
    <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=660#c8>

Changes from release 0.3 to release 0.3.1:

    Bug fix: ftp and http downloads were not working.

Changes from release 0.2 to release 0.3:

    Removed configuration variable GLOBUS_VAR_DIRECTORY, replaced
    with the more general GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.  If this is set,
    the tmp and var subdirectories, and certain files under etc, are
    automatically replaced with symlinks into GLOBUS_LOCAL_DIRECTORY.

    Print any manual steps even if gpt-wizard terminates abnormally.

    Provide better instructions for inetd/xinetd.

    Corrected bug in inetd.conf entry for gsigatekeeper.

    Bug fix: Pay attention to GLOBUS_HOSTNAME if it's set.

    Allow root INSTALLER_USER and INSTALLER_GROUP.  (To do: allow
    gpt-wizard to be run by a non-root user.)

    Miscellanous bells, whistles, and bug fixes.

Changes from release 0.1.1 to release 0.2:

    Bug fixes and enhancements for inetd and xinetd configuration.

    The default for the "-startup" option is now "-nostartup".

    Use wget for both ftp and http URLs; dropped use of ncftpget.

    New config variable WGET specifies the full path to the "wget"
    command; if not set, search in the specified PATH.

    Create a $GLOBUS_LOCATION/.gpt-wizard directory containing a
    copy of the config file and an "info" file with information about
    the build.

    Support line continuation with '\' in config file.

    Added ".PREFIX" pseudo-option, prepended to any following file
    or URL options specified with relative pathnames.

    Miscellaneous bug fixes.

    (In spite of all this, the TODO list has gotten longer, not
    shorter.)

Changes from release 0.1 to release 0.1.1:

    Added -version option

    Disabled obsolete -gpt-log option.

    Updated explanation of option parsing.
